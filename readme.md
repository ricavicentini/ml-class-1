Machine Learning Basics with Python
Welcome to the Machine Learning Basics with Python repository! This repository is created as part of my learning journey in understanding and applying machine learning techniques using Python. The goal is to experiment with small projects, code samples, and algorithms to strengthen my knowledge in this field.

üåü Project Overview
This repository contains a single script that uses scikit-learn (skit-learn) to predict the daily variation of stock prices based on three key features:

Stock price movement (increased/decreased) the previous day.

Negotiation volume (high/low) the previous day.

Closing price value (high/low) the previous day.

The algorithm used in the script is LinearSVC from scikit-learn, which helps train a simple machine learning model on labeled data and make predictions.

üßë‚Äçüíª Code Details
Training Data
The script includes training data for six different stocks:

stock1 (AAPL), stock2 (GOOGL), stock3 (MSFT), stock4 (AMZN), stock5 (TSLA), stock6 (FB)

Each stock is represented by a set of features, and the corresponding tags indicate whether the stock price increased (1) or decreased (0).

Test Data
Three new stocks are used for testing:

new_stock1 (AAPL), new_stock2 (GOOGL), new_stock3 (MSFT)

The model predicts whether the stock price increased (1) or decreased (0), and the accuracy of the predictions is evaluated using accuracy_score from scikit-learn.

üì¶ Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python libraries:

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

numpy (optional, if needed for numerical operations).

Install the dependencies using:

bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-basics.git
cd machine-learning-basics
Run the Python script:

bash
python main.py
Observe the accuracy rate output, which evaluates the model's performance.
